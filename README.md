# Traffic Predictive Coordination App (work in progress)

## Introduction
This repository is for the ongoing development of an open-source, NTCIP-based Traffic Predictive Coordination application. The app uses NTCIP to collect detector volume/occupancy logs from signal controllers and send set pattern commands. The basic functionality will be to respond to live traffic, with advanced functionality to include forecasting traffic (hence the name).

Here is a screenshot of the app interface so far:

And here is a screenshot of the app collecting data from two test controllers:

It dosen't make pattern selections yet, that's the next step.


## Contribution
The project is open for contributions, it is still in the early stages of development.
