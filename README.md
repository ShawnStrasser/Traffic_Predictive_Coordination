# Traffic Predictive Coordination App (work in progress)

## Introduction
This repository is for the ongoing development of an open-source, NTCIP-based Traffic Predictive Coordination application. The app uses NTCIP to collect detector volume/occupancy logs from signal controllers and send set pattern commands. The basic functionality will be to respond to live traffic, with advanced functionality to include forecasting traffic (hence the name).


## Contribution
The project is open for contributions, it is still in the early stages of development.
